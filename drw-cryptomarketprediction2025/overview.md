# Overview


## Notes
1. The training dataset covers the period from March 1, 2023, to February 29, 2024. The test data comes after the training period, though its timestamps are masked. Since data relevance matters, you don’t have to use the entire training set—feel free to focus on a specific window, such as only the most recent months, if that works better for your model.
2. Focus Area
   - Data Exploration and Feature Analysis - Understanding the characteristics of the anonymized proprietary features and extracting meaningful insights from public market data through data mining and statistical analysis.
   - Advanced Modeling Techniques - Developing machine learning models that effectively select, capture and integrate as much information as possible from all the available features.
